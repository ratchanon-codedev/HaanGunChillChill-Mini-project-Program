Party Discount Calculator
My first little project, which came from my daily life :3 When I go shopping with friends and there are discounts on many items, but I'm too lazy to think about how much each person has to pay. This program was created to solve this problem!

The Idea: This idea came about when I was out shopping with friends. We bought several items, and each had a different discount. When it was time to pay, we got confused about how to split the bill. Who should get how much of the discount? So, I thought, "It would be great if there was a simple program to help with this calculation!"

Right now, I don't know how to use functions in C yet, so I'm just using basic switch-case statements and while or for loops. Once I learn more, I want to come back and improve this code. For now, the calculation logic in my program isn't working correctly. See you later

22/9/2568: Last week I learn a function in a C program in my lecture class and lab class. I added something to my code, but now I don't know how to view my code history in github.
